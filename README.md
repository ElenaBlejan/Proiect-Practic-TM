#  <h1 align="center"> Final Project for ITF Manual Testing Course <h1>
# OrangeHRM Project

# 1.*Introduction* 
This test plan describes the strategies, process, workflows and methodologies used to plan, organize, execute and manage testing process for OrangeHRM browser application, **PIM** module, Submenu Add Employee, Employee list and Personal details. 

## 1.1 Project Objective

The scope of the final project for ITF Manual Testing Course is to use all gained knowledge throught the course and apply them in practice, using a live application. 

Application under test: [OrangeHRM](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login)

Original documentation: [OrangeHRM](https://www.orangehrm.com/assets/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf?url=/Files/Complete-Administrative-User-Guide.pdf)


Tools used: Jira, PostMan, MySql

## 1.2 Functionalities in scope

> - All features of PIM ( Submenu: Add Employee and Employee list ) module which were defined in software requirement specification need to be: Functional testing, GUI testing, API testing.

## 1.3 Functionalities and tests out of scope
> - All OrangeHRM features except PIM - Add employee and Employee list modules.
> - Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
> - No QA support for mobile application developed. Only web application will be tested.
> - Automation testing is beyond scope.

# 2. *Test Process*
## 2.1 Test planning
**Roles and responsabilities:**


| ROLE  | NAME    |
| :-----: | :---: | 
| Software Developer | Loredana Alexe   | 
| Product Owner | Iulia Oprescu  | 
| Project Manager | Madalina Vladu | 
| QA Engineer | Elena Blejan | 
| Senior QA Engineer | Diana Dumitru |

**Entry criteria :**
> - functional specification defined
> - roles needed for the project are allocated
> - initial project risks were detected and mitigated

**Exit criteria :**
> - all test cases have been executed
> - the number of unresolved bugs is insignificant or have low priority
> - all resolved bugs have been re-tested and closed by the QA team
> - deadline was reached
> - no detected major risks remained un-mitigated

**Risks:**

***Project risks:***
> - lack of experience of the QA team
> - only one QA in the QA team
> - unavalability of the test environment
> - short deadline of Zephyr Squad and Jira tools

***Product risks:***
> - validation constraints on the fields might be too restrictive to the end user 

## 2.2 Test Analysis

> - Analyze business requirements to make sure that we have all information for creating the test condition
> - Write test conditions that will be tested out in test process.

## 2.3 Test Design

> - functional test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad
> - GUI test cases will be created in Zephyr Squad
> - API test cases will be created in Postman
> - the test design techniques used for generating test cases are: equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis.
